# Beginner Haskell Grammar
## Blog 3

Whenever I am trying to learn how to code in a new language, I try to make sure I understand the basic grammar of the language. Jumping straight into a language and learning as you go is a decent way to learn, but I find I get hung up on the little things, such as how to write conditional statements. So over a few weeks learning Haskell, I did some research and compiled a list of basic Haskell Grammar. It has been very helpful to me as a reference when coding in Haskell.

> - && - boolean *and*
> - || - boolean *or*
> - == - tests equality
> - /= - tests “is not equal to”
> - succ- returns successor if it is defined
>      ex. succ 8 returns 9
> - min/max- takes two things and returns the min (smallest) or max (largest) of the two
> - infix function- placed between two items with backticks ` ` to make order clearer
> -    ex. 92 `div` 10 returns 9
> -    -division function *div* does not work with decimals and does not return decimal remainder
> - if/else statements- else is mandatory, every expression and function must return something
> -    -can be written in one line, ex: doublenumber x = if x>100 then x else x*2
> - **‘** is a valid character in functions
> - Function names can’t start with a capital letter
> - if a function has no parameters, it is a definition
> -    ex. helloWorld = “Hello World!”
> - odd-returns True if number is odd, False if not
> - even-returns True if number is even, False if not

There are obviously more functions and grammar rules, but this set includes a lot of useful and commonly used functions. It is great for Haskell beginners and really helped me be able to learn the language without getting caught up on little things.
