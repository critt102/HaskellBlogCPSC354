Article: [Haskell, the Language Most Likely to Change the Way you Think About Programming](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/haskell-the-language-most_b_4242119)

When I was first learning about Haskell, I was confused by it.
In school, I had learned mostly about imperative coding languages.
So when it came to coding in Haskell, I mainly struggled because I felt like the way Haskell was written wasn't detailed enough to work.

Aaron Contorer, in his article "Haskell, the Language Most Likely to Change the Way you Think About Programming", describes Haskell as "the purest functional programming language."
He goes on to say that Haskell is "much cleaner and more direct" compared to imperative coding languages. He also said that the reason Haskell isn't very popular due to its
"reputation for being hard to learn, an open-source toolchain that is time consuming to assemble."

I know I struggled with learning this language, and I also struggled with setting it up on my computer, as I talked about in a previous blog.
But despite its downfalls, Haskell was ranked number one of all coding languages for the following statements:

“Learning this language significantly changed how I use other languages.”

“Learning this language improved my ability as a programmer.”

When it comes to the first statement, I am not sure if it applies me. I have been coding in Haskell only for the past few months, but once I start coding in other languages again,
I am sure I will get a sense of whether I agree with this statement. I can see where this statements is coming from though, as it feels like Haskell is almost a simplified or broken
down version of an imperative coding language.

I would agree with the second statement, but I am not sure if I would put it as my number one. Every time I learn a new language, I feel that my coding skills are improved.
I know my skills with recursive programming have definitely improved over the last few months. I have used recursion before in other coding languages, but I have always
struggled with comprehending it, and implementing it. But since there are no while loops in Haskell, not using recursion wasn't an option. If I had to pick a language as my
number one for the a language that has improved my ability as a programmer, I would say it would have to be Python or Java. Python did a great job teaching me the basics of coding,
and Java did a great job teaching me how to write in imperative coding languages.

Overall, I believe that learning Haskell is useful for people who want to understand how other programming languages work at a fundamental level.
